Azahar is an upcoming collaboration between Lime3DS and PabloMK7's Citra fork.

Our mission is to create the definitive platform for future development of Citra, a discontinued 3DS emulator.

We hope you will join us on this journey.

More information will be released as time passes. For now, work continues behind the scenes.
